Please have a look at the recent commits which attempted to fuse the camera code (added in tmp/camera-standalone-for-cross-check for cross-reference) with the netpoke's client network tester. 

Refer to the 2025-12-05-network-measurement-implementation.md and 2025-12-05-network-measurement-system-design.md in docs/plans/ for the tentative implementation plans - but ensure also to refer to tmp/camera-standalone-for-cross-check/* - because that directory contains the working code.

If you find discrepancies, have a look at the process described in docs/issues/README.md, and then document the found issues accordingly, in a way that is suitable for resolving by a less qualified engineer/LLM. Please document as many discrepancies/issues as you can find ! Thank you!
